# FDCToolbox
Toolbox for F16 Flight Dynamics and Control Systems Analysis

to install on local computer use "pip install git+https://github.com/parthp08/FDCToolbox"


NOTE: most of the code in this package belongs to  https://github.com/stanleybak/AeroBenchVVPython. this is just a change in file structure and
some minor changes to use code as a package for easiness to obtain a aircraft model for learning control theory 
from later chapters in the book [1].
